	<h1>Interviews I&#39;ve Gone and Done <aside></aside></h1>
	

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a full-time software engineer for about 5 years. I&rsquo;m currently in my second full-time engineering job. I&rsquo;ve interviewed at dozens of companies and have been given about four job offers. Over the last 6 or 7 years I&rsquo;ve come across a lot of interview questions. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the puzzles, sometimes it was like a sentient &ldquo;cracking the coding interview&rdquo; was making fun of me. Some interviews were near-misses (I think) and others made me question my choice of career.<br />
Here is a retrospective of questions that have stood out to me, organized in no particular way and with inconsistent commentary.</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>

<p>This first section is about (some of) the questions I&rsquo;ve faced.</p>

<h2 id="real-time-in-person-over-the-phone-video-chat">Real-time (in-person/over the phone/video chat)</h2>

<p>These are questions that I&rsquo;ve been asked in a &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; interview. Things that fall under this category are on-site interviews, phone calls, and video calls.</p>

<h3 id="let-s-talk-about-some-code-they-ve-presented-me-with">let&rsquo;s talk about [some code they&rsquo;ve presented me with]</h3>

<p>This is generally a somewhat recent revision or simplified piece of production code. Through no coincidence, these samples contain entrypoints into a number of different topics. One example is some Python code that handled signals from the operating system. Even though it was Python (i.e. - relatively &ldquo;high-level&rdquo;) code, the interviewer and I still discussed topics like concurrent programming and Linux syscalls.</p>

<h3 id="given-a-service-architecture-you-receive-the-following-alert-insert-alert-here-what-do-you-do">[given a service architecture], you receive the following alert: [insert alert here], what do you do?</h3>

<p>This gave me a chance to demonstrate my troubleshooting (aka &ldquo;firefighting&rdquo;) capabilities. I had everything that I thought a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; production system might have at my fingertips. It felt like a choose-your-own-adventure production emergency. Can I look at the logs? Yes, and they say [something potentially useful]. Do we have graphs of response codes? Yes, and here&rsquo;s what it looks like: [jpg of a graph with 5xx errors going up and to the right].<br />
This probably isn&rsquo;t something you could expect a new grad (bootcamp or bachelors or otherwise) to know, but could hopefully be asked of anyone with more than a year or so of experience. It felt like one of those old text-based RPGs, like adventure.</p>

<h3 id="some-kind-of-sql-question-that-involved-common-table-expressions-but-i-didn-t-get-a-job-offer-so-who-knows-if-it-was-actually-supposed-to-involve-common-table-expressions">Some kind of SQL question that involved common table expressions, but I didn’t get a job offer so who knows if it was actually supposed to involve common table expressions?</h3>

<p>This was something like &ldquo;given a table with columns <code>name</code> and <code>parent_name</code>, find all grandparents&rdquo;. Brutal.<br />
Of all my interviews, only a small handful actually contained SQL questions. I&rsquo;m a little surprised at how rarely I get asked about SQL in interviews, given how useful it&rsquo;s been to me. I guess it&rsquo;s a little like how companies will include &ldquo;proficiency with the command-line&rdquo; in a job description but will never, ever follow-up on it.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-a-server">Exploring a server</h3>

<p>But some companies do follow up on it! This was basically &ldquo;you&rsquo;re on a server and want to find out ____, how do you do it?&rdquo; While the interviewer asked for specific commands and flags, they could definitely relate when I responded with &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I need [random assortment of flags] but it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always used and it&rsquo;s worked so far&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h3>

<p>I feel these usually come out when a company tries to come off as having &ldquo;conversational&rdquo; interviews when really it just wants to admit that its interviews are quizzes</p>

<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the difference between an inner and outer join?<br /></li>
<li>[fill out this table of REST keywords and whether or not they&rsquo;re idempotent (plus some other properties but I can&rsquo;t remember)]<br /></li>
<li>What&rsquo;s map/reduce?<br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="take-home-exercises">Take-home exercises</h2>

<p>These exercises were typically given to me with the expectation that they&rsquo;d take anywhere between 2 and 10 hours. I inevitably exceeded those time frames.</p>

<p>Take-home exercises have at least one very clear upside: they reduce the anxiety of an interview by making it asynchronous. There&rsquo;s no one looking over your shoulder, interrupting your thought process by peppering you with questions while you&rsquo;re trying to think of variable names.</p>

<p>In my opinion, they also have a less-clear downside: it&rsquo;s harder for interviewers to get feedback on the question. Interviewers will still be able to build up an intuition about how various folks answer a problem, but there&rsquo;s no reliable way to know how long something took to complete. They have no idea how often someone gets hung up on an awkwardly-worded requirement.<br />
I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever had a follow-up conversation about a code sample, which is disappointing. Seems like it&rsquo;d be a good opportunity for the applicant to get some useful feedback, and for the hiring team to hopefully learn a bit more about how their questions are being perceived.</p>

<p>With that said, here are some take-home exercises I&rsquo;ve gotten over the years</p>

<h3 id="here-is-some-code-related-to-technical-thing-please-tell-us-how-it-works-and-what-you-might-infer-about-how-we-handle-technical-thing">Here is some code related to [technical thing], please tell us how it works and what you might infer about how we handle [technical thing]</h3>

<p>Similar to the first &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; question, except that this was done without someone looking over my shoulder and also I had to give a little more umprompted feedback. I had to be proactive. At times it felt like writing down certain things and then asking myself &ldquo;am I reading into this too much?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="write-a-terraform-script-to-spin-up-an-environment-in-aws-with-components">Write a Terraform script to spin up an environment in AWS with [components]</h3>

<p>I forget what the &ldquo;components&rdquo; were, but the exercise was to see how one would go about writing a Terraform script (configuration? I don&rsquo;t know what the right Terraform name is) to spin up some AWS resources. It was for a DevOps role and, I imagine, very closely mirrored what the role would be like.</p>

<h3 id="write-a-tcp-server-in-scala">Write a TCP server in Scala</h3>

<p>If I recall correctly, the full prompt was to write a server that could listen on a socket and parse messages in a custom protocol built atop TCP. I replied a day later to withdraw my application.</p>

<h1 id="interview-questions-and-process-efforts">Interview questions and process efforts</h1>

<p>I think most people who have ever interviewed, for engineering positions or otherwise, have stories of companies that never replied after an interview, or who strung them along for a while before finally saying no, or whose process was filled with contextless hypotheticals that clearly didn&rsquo;t reflect the kind of work the role required. This section is for two examples of the other end of the spectrum.</p>

<ul>
<li>Private AWS account

<ul>
<li>There were limits to what I could do, but at the start of a take-home exercise I was provided a login and allowed to test my code against a real AWS environment. This set the company apart as it was a small company with dedicated and competent AWS administrators. That&rsquo;s not a guarantee, and &ldquo;cloud infrastructure&rdquo; can be absolutely soul-crushing if done without backup.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Slack access

<ul>
<li>There were limits to what I could do, but I was given access to a private room, DM access to the interview team, and access to the organizations custom Slack emojis.</li>
<li>The company that did this was almost entirely distributed, so seeing how someone can communicate over Slack was probably a legitimate test of &ldquo;can I work with this person?&rdquo; for them.
<br /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these companies blew me away with how much effort they put into putting their candidate in a practical scenario.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">conclusions?</h1>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m any better at interviewing because of these experiences. The people who&rsquo;ve &ldquo;gotten it right&rdquo;, in my opinion, have been those who set a clear expectation for proficiency in certain areas and test exactly that. I&rsquo;ve also found that I enjoy speaking with interviewers who have seemingly mapped out the decision tree of their questions and can tell when I&rsquo;m on the wrong branch. I might not have gotten the job, but at least I didn&rsquo;t hate myself after the interview. That&rsquo;s a low bar to clear, but not everyone has cleared it.</p>
